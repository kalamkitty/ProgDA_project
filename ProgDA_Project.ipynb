    "The phenomenon I have chosen to investigate for this project is risk of a person developing type 2 diabetes in Ireland. The reasoning is that in my family for the past generations, seem to have developed type two diabetes at the ages between 40 and 60. A person is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes if their blood glucose is above 200mg/dl. The main factors that I will be examining is the blood glucose levels, the age of the person, their alcohol consumption and their body mass index.\n",

    "As people get older,their risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases, this could be due to increased insulin resistance which in cause their blood glucose levels to rise. According to a study which looks at the the relationship between age and diabetes, it was found that there is a higher risk of diabetes in the older population. Over 40% of people who are 65 years old and older meet the criteria to be considered diabetic (Chang and Halter, 2003).
